% The fonts, linespacing, numbering, page styles, order
% of  Title/Abstract/TOC/Body/{Appendices}/Acknowledgements/References 
% are prescribed as the AIMS house style.
%
% Do not change them or add to it without getting approval first.
% Essays are not accepted if they do not follow house style.
% This is in preparation for your Masters/PhD where the university
% will be much more strict on the house style.

%-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
% To use external packages for specific needs, 
% get approval before adding them here (they
% should not override general AIMS house style and layout).
%
% Examples:
%
% For Arabic
%\usepackage{arabtex}
%\usepackage{utf8}


%\setcode{utf8}
% For tables:
\usepackage{booktabs} % \toprule, \midrule, \bottomrule
\usepackage{array}    % \newcolumntype
% 
% For figures:
\usepackage[below]{placeins} % use \FloatBarrier in the body
% \usepackage{float}  %"H" placement spec, for **really here** (i.e. not float)
\usepackage{caption} %many figures in one figure (note subfigure and subfig are deprecated)
\usepackage{subcaption} %many figures in one figure (note subfigure and subfig are deprecated)
%
% For code and algorithms
\usepackage{moreverb}   % \verbatimtabinput
% For links and hyper references
\usepackage{hyperref}
\urlstyle{same}
% \usepackage{listings} % more flexible and complicated 
                        % than moreverb and algorithm
% 
% Others
% \usepackage[all]{xy} 
 \usepackage{sagetex}
% \usepackage{siunitx} % to typeset numbers, units, align decimals in tables.
% \usepackage{dcolumn} % less flexible but maybe faster than siunitx above.
% \usepackage{mathtools} % More maths, e.g. \mathclap.
\usepackage{epstopdf}
\usepackage{psfrag}
\usepackage{graphics}% Others may be landscape, longtable, algorithm, algorithmic, etc.
\usepackage{lineno} % This package together with lineno.sty numbers every line. Makes it easy for edditing.

% Numbers lines
\linenumbers
% 
% ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
% An AIMS Essay can use the sectioning commands "\chapter", "\section",
% "\subsection". No "\subsubsection", "\paragraph", etc. They are disabled.
% 
% For Theorems and such, use the environments defined here:
% \begin{thm}...\end{thm} (or "lem", "defn", etc)
% 
% We put the number to the left of the Theorem heading.
\swapnumbers 
% 
% Theorems are in italics.
\theoremstyle{plain}
\newtheorem{thm}[subsection]{Theorem}
%
% Rest is not in italics.
\theoremstyle{definition} 
\newtheorem{lem}[subsection]{Lemma}
\newtheorem{cor}[subsection]{Corollary}
\newtheorem{conj}[subsection]{Conjecture}
\newtheorem{pro}[subsection]{Proposition}
\newtheorem{exa}[subsection]{Example}
\newtheorem{defn}[subsection]{Definition}
\newtheorem{rem}[subsection]{Remark}
% 
% If you have no theorems, but a lot of equations, maybe the
% following two lines are good. Beware of corresponding Equation
% and Example numbers though! Number equations by sections.
% 
\numberwithin{equation}{section}
%
%-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
% s are usually written in English, with a version in your
% mother tongue underneath.
%
% French, Twi, Arabic, Malagasy, etc. students use normal LaTeX
% for special characters, for example \'{e}
%
% Amharic students use LibreOffice to write Amharic,
% export and include a figure.
%
%\begin{RLtext}    
%Here is where the arabic text goes.
%You can just type it with an arabic keyboard
%\end{RLtext}\\
%-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
% Your own command shortcuts can go here
% keep them clearly separate from other sections of the preamble
% It is good style to have only a few of these so that
% we can read one another's code. If you have too many, 
% then your code does not compile in someone else's template easily,
% and it makes it harder to read. These definitions are only
% meant for very often-used commands to save typing; Examples:
%
%\newcommand {\be}{\begin{equation}}
%\newcommand {\ee}{\end{equation}}
%\newcommand {\C}{\mathbb{C}} % Complex
%\newcommand {\Z}{\mathbb{Z}} % Integers
%\newcommand {\R}{\mathbb{R}} % Real
%\DeclareMathOperator{\sech}{sech} % declaring new math operators like \sin.
%  
%-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
% Title & Author
% On this page you must have NO full-word capitalizations, bold, or colour. 
% All AIMS essays per year have the same title page.
% In English your family name is written last, i.e. Firstname LASTNAME
% English Capitalization, not as in some Francophone countries where
% you write LASTNAME, Firstname.
% Put your AIMS email address only please, for consistency,
% not gmail or some other webmail address.
\title{The Title}
% Your name must be in CAPITAL with no comma, 
% and the Family name comes last.

% Uncomment the next four lines and edit the name

% Figures may differ between topics, but they are not there
