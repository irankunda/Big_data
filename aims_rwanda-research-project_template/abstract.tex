Reports are key source of information for all activities within  organizations. Electronic reports are generated day to day in unstructured way. It is still a big challenge to know automatically what the reports are talking about.  For big organizations like International Federation of Red Cross(IFRC) where they work in humanitarian domain, some information from their reports are quietly necessary and very important. Within million reports, automation of extracting information saves time and increase quality. Needed information from the reports are called Named entities. This research, We used machine learning algorithms such as Stanford NER, polyglot and Natural language toolkit  to extract named entities from IFRC reports. We are looking for the answer of " Who did what when How" from the documents.
