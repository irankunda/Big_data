\chapter{Conclusion and Future work}
Entities extraction has been performed using natural language toolkit, polyglot and Stanford named entity recognition.
Evaluation of entity extraction is normally done by the metrics of precision, accuracy and recall between algorithms and named extracted by human hands.  This research argues that top section of report has meaningful metrics. The results demonstrate that a process of extracting names of persons in top section of reports was well done.

As future work, the next step for entity extraction  is to work on other sections of a document.  To combine all used approaches into a software which can automatically visualised entity named by organization such as budget, number of people suffered from a disaster e
